MVP 3:
Create a function toggleTemperatureDisplay that returns either Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on which was the last returned 
(if the last value returned was Fahrenheit, then youâ€™ll want to return Celsius and vice versa). Start with a default of the last returned format being Celsius.

1. declare a new function toggleTemperatureDisplay

2. create a parameter called currentTemp which will take in a number input 

3. Assume for now currentTemp parameter will be in Celcius

4. BODY OF THE FUNCTION

    CONVERT A TEMPERATURE IN Celcius TO Fahrenheit

    A. function takes in a parameter currentTemp
    - But how do we know if currentTemp is C or F?
    - The function can't tell if inputTemp is C or F, but it can test if a variable is True or False
    - And how do we toggle it between C & F?

    B. The function needs to know if it's C or F so that it can toggle it to the opposite
    - Take the input parameter inputTemp and change it to T or F within the body of the function, 
    - depending on whether the variable is True of False 
    - We will create a new variable which is the boolean isCelcius
    - We will set this to True initially (meaning temperature is in Celcius by default)
    - If isCelcius is true, we need to convert inputTemp to Fahrenheit

5. RETURN OUTPUT

    - Temperature in either Celcius or Fahrenheit

6. Build the above and test it works

7. Update the plan to add the inverse logic, Fahrenheit to Celcius

8. Test again

9. Refactor the code to call the functions we already produced at MVP1 & MVP2

10. Test again!
